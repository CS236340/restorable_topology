# Implementing a restorable logical topology

This project is an attempt to implement the MM-SRLG algorithm presented in the paper "Restorable Logical Topology in the Face of No or Partial Traffic Demand Knowledge" by Prof. Reuven Cohen and Dr. Gabi Nakibly.

There are two main components:

1) A remote controller application, either:

	a) based on the MM-SRLG algorithm.
	b) based on a customized algorithm that uses disjoint paths to find routes between logical nodes.

2) A Mininet topology initializer


This project has been tested with RYU version 4.2.
